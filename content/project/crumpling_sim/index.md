As part of my current research, I have been developing a large-scale simulation of thin, elastoplastic sheets to aid our study and analysis of crumpling dynamics.  

A popular model for elastic materials is a mass-spring system: a collection of discrete nodes that interact with their neighbors via linear springs. This simple framework can accurately reproduce continuum elastic properties of the material.

In our work, we build on the widely-used elastic membrane model of Seung and Nelson[^1] and extend it to simulate self-avoiding, elastoplastic sheets. A key consideration in our implementation is the numerical procedure used to integrate the equations of motion for the sheet. We recognize that a sheet undergoing crumpling exhibits deformations on two different timescales: a slower timescale for wide-range smooth deformation, and a faster timescale for rapid buckling and local changes in velocity. This motivates two different formulations of the equations of motion: a quasistatic formulation in which acceleration is approximated as zero, and a dynamic formulation that retains acceleration as non-negligible. The quasistatic formulation may be efficiently integrated using an implicit scheme, while the dynamic formulation is handled explicitly. The complete model is implemented in C++ and multithreaded using OpenMP, and a paper for this work is currently in preparation.

The video above demonstrates one example simulation of a thin sheet radially confined into a ball. The sheet is modeled by 46767 nodes and 92716 triangles distributed randomly in a square domain. The sheet is compressed by a radial potential that mimics a spherical shell with decreasing radius. Short-range repulsive forces enforce the sheetâ€™s self-avoidance, and plastic damage accumulates as regions of the sheet develop a large enough local curvature. Particularly interesting is the observation of individual snap-throughs of flat surfaces as the sheet locks in creases. The cross-sectional view midway through the video also reveals a high degree of layering of the sheet. After compressing for a time, the radius of the enclosing shell begins to increase, allowing the crumpled sheet to relax. At the end, the relaxed state of the sheet displays permanent plastic damage.
