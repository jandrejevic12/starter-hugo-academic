As part of my current research with Prof. Chris Rycroft, I have been developing a large-scale simulation of thin, elastoplastic sheets to aid our study and analysis of crumpling dynamics. The simulation is implemented in C++ and multithreaded using OpenMP. Specific components of the numerical implementation will be discussed separately; the video below demonstrates one example simulation of a thin sheet radially confined into a ball.

The sheet is modeled as a triangulated lattice of discrete nodes which interact with their neighbors via stretching, bending, and damping forces. The example shown consists of 46767 nodes and 92716 triangles distributed randomly in a square domain. The sheet is compressed by a radial potential that mimics a spherical shell with decreasing radius. Short-range repulsive forces enforce the sheetâ€™s self-avoidance, and plastic damage accumulates as regions of the sheet develop a large enough local curvature. Particularly interesting is the observation of individual snap-throughs of flat surfaces as the sheet locks in creases. The cross-sectional view midway through the video also reveals a high degree of layering of the sheet. After compressing for a time, the radius of the enclosing shell begins to increase, allowing the crumpled sheet to relax. The relaxed state of the sheet displays permanent plastic damage.
