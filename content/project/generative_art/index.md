Together with Nina Andrejevic, George Varnavides, and Amina Matt, I helped to design and co-facilitate a winter workshop on generative art at MIT in January of 2020. The course emphasizes mathematical and natural examples of pattern formation such as fractals, cellular automata, swarming and self-organization, and emergent structure in reaction-diffusion processes. The content of the course includes both relevant theory behind these examples, as well as effective strategies for implementation in code.

Material from past iterations can be found on the course's [Github repository](https://github.com/gvarnavi/generative-art-iap).
