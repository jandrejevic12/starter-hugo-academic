Hello! My name is Jovana, and I am a PhD candidate in Applied Physics in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University. Prior to Harvard, I received my bachelor’s degree in Engineering Physics at Cornell University in 2016. As a member of Prof. Chris Rycroft’s research group, I use computational approaches to study the crumpling dynamics of thin, elastoplastic sheets: how they deform, buckle, and develop rich, chaotic damage networks that exhibit surprising mathematical order. Broadly, I am interested in the intersection of physics-based modeling and data-driven methods to recognize patterns and structure in complex, disordered systems.

I was born in Leskovac, Serbia, and moved to the suburbs of Chicago with my parents and twin sister at the age of seven. I have loved drawing and art since childhood and am passionate about creating graphics to promote science communication to a broader audience. You can check out some of my projects in the Visualization section!
