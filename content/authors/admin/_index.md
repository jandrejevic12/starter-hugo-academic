Hello! My name is Jovana, and I am a PhD candidate in Applied Physics in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University. As a member of Prof. Chris Rycroftâ€™s research group, I use computational approaches to study the crumpling dynamics of thin, elastoplastic sheets: how they deform, buckle, and develop rich, chaotic damage networks that exhibit surprising mathematical order. Broadly, I am interested in the intersection of physics-based modeling and data-driven methods to recognize patterns and structure in complex, disordered systems. Alongside research, I am passionate about teaching as well as creating graphics to promote science communication to a broader audience.
