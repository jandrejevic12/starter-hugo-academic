Hello! My name is Jovana, and I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pennsylvania applying computational methods to address questions in soft matter. In 2022, I completed my PhD in Applied Physics at Harvard University under the supervision of Prof. Chris Rycroft. In my PhD work, I studied the crumpling dynamics of thin, elastoplastic sheets: how they deform, buckle, and develop rich, chaotic damage networks that exhibit surprising mathematical order. Broadly, I am interested in the intersection of physics-based modeling and data-driven methods to recognize patterns and structure in complex, disordered systems. Alongside research, I am passionate about [teaching](/teaching/teaching_summary/) as well as creating [graphics](#graphics) to promote science communication to a broader audience.

A copy of my current CV is [available here.](uploads/resume.pdf)
